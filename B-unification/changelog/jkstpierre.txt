  - Proved with Professor Dougherty that substitutions 
    distribute. This was the final link required for 
    connecting the fundamental idea behind unification, 
    namely that "sigma" being a unifier for terms "t1, t2"
    if (sigma t1) = (sigma t2) is equivalent to saying
    (sigma t) = 0 for some term t.
  - Wrote functions for evaluating ground terms to 0 or 1.
  - Wrote definition for a more general substitution.
  - Wrote definition for a most general unifier.
  - Proved an example from the book for being a most 
    general unifier
