CFG-formalizations and verifiedMessagingSystem are each papers that
describe (large) Coq projects.

The first is in the "formalize some math" category, the second is in
the "formalize an application" category.

The smolka_brown file is course notes for a Coq course.    See Chapter 9;
if we work on E-unification we would take off from that chapter.

The Wikipedia page on unifcation is good.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science)
It has a section on E-unification.
