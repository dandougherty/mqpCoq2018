This version is for distributution to MQP team.  It is not really
finished: there are some "Admitted"s, and some sophisticated tactics
to be replaced by elementary ones (for pedagogical reasons).  But it
is correct modulo the Admitteds.

To compile the Coq:
> make clean; make

To generate the pdf:
> make clean; make; make all.pdf

The Makefile was generated by
> coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile

The _CoqProject file is built by hand

starting with Smolka+Brown, made various changes (esp using reflection
instead of sumbool)

- had to change "Base" to SB_Base" (avoid conflict with Coq library?)

- in "unif" line 220: "t is already used".  Weird.
Changed the "t" to "u"
