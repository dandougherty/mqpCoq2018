(** * Inductively Defined Propositions *)

(** In the [Logic] chapter, we looked at several ways of writing
    propositions, including conjunction, disjunction, and quantifiers.
    In this chapter, we bring a new tool into the mix: _inductive
    definitions_. *)

(** Recall that we have seen two ways of stating that a number [n] is
    even: We can say (1) [evenb n = true], or (2) [exists k, n =
    double k].  Yet another possibility is to say that [n] is even if
    we can establish its evenness from the following rules:

       - Rule [ev_0]:  The number [0] is even.
       - Rule [ev_SS]: If [n] is even, then [S (S n)] is even. *)

(** To illustrate how this definition of evenness works, let's
    imagine using it to show that [4] is even. By rule [ev_SS], it
    suffices to show that [2] is even. This, in turn, is again
    guaranteed by rule [ev_SS], as long as we can show that [0] is
    even. But this last fact follows directly from the [ev_0] rule. *)

(** We will see many definitions like this one during the rest
    of the course.  For purposes of informal discussions, it is
    helpful to have a lightweight notation that makes them easy to
    read and write.  _Inference rules_ are one such notation: *)
(**

                              ------------                        (ev_0)
                                 ev 0

                                  ev n
                             --------------                      (ev_SS)
                              ev (S (S n))
*)

(** Each of the textual rules above is reformatted here as an
    inference rule; the intended reading is that, if the _premises_
    above the line all hold, then the _conclusion_ below the line
    follows.  For example, the rule [ev_SS] says that, if [n]
    satisfies [ev], then [S (S n)] also does.  If a rule has no
    premises above the line, then its conclusion holds
    unconditionally.

    We can represent a proof using these rules by combining rule
    applications into a _proof tree_. Here's how we might transcribe
    the above proof that [4] is even: *)
(**

                             ------  (ev_0)
                              ev 0
                             ------ (ev_SS)
                              ev 2
                             ------ (ev_SS)
                              ev 4
*)

(** Why call this a "tree" (rather than a "stack", for example)?
    Because, in general, inference rules can have multiple premises.
    We will see examples of this below. *)

(** Putting all of this together, we can translate the definition of
    evenness into a formal Coq definition using an [Inductive]
    declaration, where each constructor corresponds to an inference
    rule: *)

Inductive ev : nat -> Prop :=
| ev_0 : ev 0
| ev_SS : forall n : nat, ev n -> ev (S (S n)).

(** This definition is different in one crucial respect from
    previous uses of [Inductive]: its result is not a [Type], but
    rather a function from [nat] to [Prop] -- that is, a property of
    numbers.  Note that we've already seen other inductive definitions
    that result in functions, such as [list], whose type is [Type ->
    Type].  What is new here is that, because the [nat] argument of
    [ev] appears _unnamed_, to the _right_ of the colon, it is allowed
    to take different values in the types of different constructors:
    [0] in the type of [ev_0] and [S (S n)] in the type of [ev_SS].

    In contrast, the definition of [list] names the [X] parameter
    _globally_, to the _left_ of the colon, forcing the result of
    [nil] and [cons] to be the same ([list X]).  Had we tried to bring
    [nat] to the left in defining [ev], we would have seen an error: *)

Fail Inductive wrong_ev (n : nat) : Prop :=
| wrong_ev_0 : wrong_ev 0
| wrong_ev_SS : forall n, wrong_ev n -> wrong_ev (S (S n)).
(* ===> Error: A parameter of an inductive type n is not
        allowed to be used as a bound variable in the type
        of its constructor. *)

(** ("Parameter" here is Coq jargon for an argument on the left of the
    colon in an [Inductive] definition; "index" is used to refer to
    arguments on the right of the colon.) *)

(** We can think of the definition of [ev] as defining a Coq property
    [ev : nat -> Prop], together with primitive theorems [ev_0 : ev 0] and
    [ev_SS : forall n, ev n -> ev (S (S n))]. *)

(** Such "constructor theorems" have the same status as proven
    theorems.  In particular, we can use Coq's [apply] tactic with the
    rule names to prove [ev] for particular numbers... *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Using Evidence in Proofs *)

(** Besides _constructing_ evidence that numbers are even, we can also
    _reason about_ such evidence.

    Introducing [ev] with an [Inductive] declaration tells Coq not
    only that the constructors [ev_0] and [ev_SS] are valid ways to
    build evidence that some number is even, but also that these two
    constructors are the _only_ ways to build evidence that numbers
    are even (in the sense of [ev]). *)

(** In other words, if someone gives us evidence [E] for the assertion
    [ev n], then we know that [E] must have one of two shapes:

      - [E] is [ev_0] (and [n] is [O]), or
      - [E] is [ev_SS n' E'] (and [n] is [S (S n')], where [E'] is
        evidence for [ev n']). *)

(** This suggests that it should be possible to analyze a hypothesis
    of the form [ev n] much as we do inductively defined data
    structures; in particular, it should be possible to argue by
    _induction_ and _case analysis_ on such evidence.  Let's look at a
    few examples to see what this means in practice. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Inversion on Evidence *)

(** Suppose we are proving some fact involving a number [n], and we
    are given [ev n] as a hypothesis.  We already know how to perform
    case analysis on [n] using the [inversion] tactic, generating
    separate subgoals for the case where [n = O] and the case where [n
    = S n'] for some [n'].  But for some proofs we may instead want to
    analyze the evidence that [ev n] _directly_.

    By the definition of [ev], there are two cases to consider:

    - If the evidence is of the form [ev_0], we know that [n = 0].

    - Otherwise, the evidence must have the form [ev_SS n' E'], where
      [n = S (S n')] and [E'] is evidence for [ev n']. *)

(** We can perform this kind of reasoning in Coq, again using
    the [inversion] tactic.  Besides allowing us to reason about
    equalities involving constructors, [inversion] provides a
    case-analysis principle for inductively defined propositions.
    When used in this way, its syntax is similar to [destruct]: We
    pass it a list of identifiers separated by [|] characters to name
    the arguments to each of the possible constructors.  *)

Theorem ev_minus2 : forall n,
  ev n -> ev (pred (pred n)).
Proof.
  intros n E.
  inversion E as [| n' E'].
  - (* E = ev_0 *) simpl. apply ev_0.
  - (* E = ev_SS n' E' *) simpl. apply E'.  Qed.

(** In words, here is how the inversion reasoning works in this proof:

    - If the evidence is of the form [ev_0], we know that [n = 0].
      Therefore, it suffices to show that [ev (pred (pred 0))] holds.
      By the definition of [pred], this is equivalent to showing that
      [ev 0] holds, which directly follows from [ev_0].

    - Otherwise, the evidence must have the form [ev_SS n' E'], where
      [n = S (S n')] and [E'] is evidence for [ev n'].  We must then
      show that [ev (pred (pred (S (S n'))))] holds, which, after
      simplification, follows directly from [E']. *)

(** This particular proof also works if we replace [inversion] by
    [destruct]: *)

Theorem ev_minus2' : forall n,
  ev n -> ev (pred (pred n)).
Proof.
  intros n E.
  destruct E as [| n' E'].
  - (* E = ev_0 *) simpl. apply ev_0.
  - (* E = ev_SS n' E' *) simpl. apply E'.  Qed.

(** The difference between the two forms is that [inversion] is more
    convenient when used on a hypothesis that consists of an inductive
    property applied to a complex expression (as opposed to a single
    variable).  Here's is a concrete example.  Suppose that we wanted
    to prove the following variation of [ev_minus2]: *)

Theorem evSS_ev : forall n,
  ev (S (S n)) -> ev n.

(** Intuitively, we know that evidence for the hypothesis cannot
    consist just of the [ev_0] constructor, since [O] and [S] are
    different constructors of the type [nat]; hence, [ev_SS] is the
    only case that applies.  Unfortunately, [destruct] is not smart
    enough to realize this, and it still generates two subgoals.  Even
    worse, in doing so, it keeps the final goal unchanged, failing to
    provide any useful information for completing the proof.  *)

Proof.
  intros n E.
  destruct E as [| n' E'].
  - (* E = ev_0. *)
    (* We must prove that [n] is even from no assumptions! *)
Abort.

(** What happened, exactly?  Calling [destruct] has the effect of
    replacing all occurrences of the property argument by the values
    that correspond to each constructor.  This is enough in the case
    of [ev_minus2'] because that argument, [n], is mentioned directly
    in the final goal. However, it doesn't help in the case of
    [evSS_ev] since the term that gets replaced ([S (S n)]) is not
    mentioned anywhere. *)

(** The [inversion] tactic, on the other hand, can detect (1) that the
    first case does not apply, and (2) that the [n'] that appears on
    the [ev_SS] case must be the same as [n].  This allows us to
    complete the proof: *)

Theorem evSS_ev : forall n,
  ev (S (S n)) -> ev n.
Proof.
  intros n E.
  inversion E as [| n' E'].
  (* We are in the [E = ev_SS n' E'] case now. *)
  apply E'.
Qed.

(** By using [inversion], we can also apply the principle of explosion
    to "obviously contradictory" hypotheses involving inductive
    properties. For example: *)

Proof.

Theorem even5_nonsense :
  ev 5 -> 2 + 2 = 9.
Proof.
  intros E. simpl. inversion E. inversion H0. inversion H2.
Qed.

(** [] *)

(** The way we've used [inversion] here may seem a bit
    mysterious at first.  Until now, we've only used [inversion] on
    equality propositions, to utilize injectivity of constructors or
    to discriminate between different constructors.  But we see here
    that [inversion] can also be applied to analyzing evidence for
    inductively defined propositions.

    Here's how [inversion] works in general.  Suppose the name [I]
    refers to an assumption [P] in the current context, where [P] has
    been defined by an [Inductive] declaration.  Then, for each of the
    constructors of [P], [inversion I] generates a subgoal in which
    [I] has been replaced by the exact, specific conditions under
    which this constructor could have been used to prove [P].  Some of
    these subgoals will be self-contradictory; [inversion] throws
    these away.  The ones that are left represent the cases that must
    be proved to establish the original goal.  For those, [inversion]
    adds all equations into the proof context that must hold of the
    arguments given to [P] (e.g., [S (S n') = n] in the proof of
    [evSS_ev]). *)

(** The [ev_double] exercise above shows that our new notion of
    evenness is implied by the two earlier ones (since, by
    [even_bool_prop] in chapter [Logic], we already know that
    those are equivalent to each other). To show that all three
    coincide, we just need the following lemma: *)

Lemma ev_even_firsttry : forall n,
  ev n -> exists k, n = double k.
Proof.
(* WORKED IN CLASS *)

(** We could try to proceed by case analysis or induction on [n].  But
    since [ev] is mentioned in a premise, this strategy would probably
    lead to a dead end, as in the previous section.  Thus, it seems
    better to first try inversion on the evidence for [ev].  Indeed,
    the first case can be solved trivially. *)

  intros n E. inversion E as [| n' E'].
  - (* E = ev_0 *)
    exists 0. reflexivity.
  - (* E = ev_SS n' E' *) simpl.

(** Unfortunately, the second case is harder.  We need to show [exists
    k, S (S n') = double k], but the only available assumption is
    [E'], which states that [ev n'] holds.  Since this isn't directly
    useful, it seems that we are stuck and that performing case
    analysis on [E] was a waste of time.

    If we look more closely at our second goal, however, we can see
    that something interesting happened: By performing case analysis
    on [E], we were able to reduce the original result to an similar
    one that involves a _different_ piece of evidence for [ev]: [E'].
    More formally, we can finish our proof by showing that

        exists k', n' = double k',

    which is the same as the original statement, but with [n'] instead
    of [n].  Indeed, it is not difficult to convince Coq that this
    intermediate result suffices. *)

    assert (I : (exists k', n' = double k') ->
                (exists k, S (S n') = double k)).
    { intros [k' Hk']. rewrite Hk'. exists (S k'). reflexivity. }
    apply I. (* reduce the original goal to the new one *)

Admitted.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Induction on Evidence *)

(** If this looks familiar, it is no coincidence: We've encountered
    similar problems in the [Induction] chapter, when trying to use
    case analysis to prove results that required induction.  And once
    again the solution is... induction!

    The behavior of [induction] on evidence is the same as its
    behavior on data: It causes Coq to generate one subgoal for each
    constructor that could have used to build that evidence, while
    providing an induction hypotheses for each recursive occurrence of
    the property in question. *)

(** Let's try our current lemma again: *)

Lemma ev_even : forall n,
  ev n -> exists k, n = double k.
Proof.
  intros n E.
  induction E as [|n' E' IH].
  - (* E = ev_0 *)
    exists 0. reflexivity.
  - (* E = ev_SS n' E'
       with IH : exists k', n' = double k' *)
    destruct IH as [k' Hk'].
    rewrite Hk'. exists (S k'). reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Here, we can see that Coq produced an [IH] that corresponds to
    [E'], the single recursive occurrence of [ev] in its own
    definition.  Since [E'] mentions [n'], the induction hypothesis
    talks about [n'], as opposed to [n] or some other number. *)

(** The equivalence between the second and third definitions of
    evenness now follows. *)

Theorem ev_even_iff : forall n,
  ev n <-> exists k, n = double k.
Proof.
  intros n. split.
  - (* -> *) apply ev_even.
  - (* <- *) intros [k Hk]. rewrite Hk. apply ev_double.
Qed.

(** As we will see in later chapters, induction on evidence is a
    recurring technique across many areas, and in particular when
    formalizing the semantics of programming languages, where many
    properties of interest are defined inductively. *)

(** The following exercises provide simple examples of this
    technique, to help you familiarize yourself with it. *)

(** * Inductive Relations *)

(** A proposition parameterized by a number (such as [ev])
    can be thought of as a _property_ -- i.e., it defines
    a subset of [nat], namely those numbers for which the proposition
    is provable.  In the same way, a two-argument proposition can be
    thought of as a _relation_ -- i.e., it defines a set of pairs for
    which the proposition is provable. *)

Module Playground.

(** One useful example is the "less than or equal to" relation on
    numbers. *)

(** The following definition should be fairly intuitive.  It
    says that there are two ways to give evidence that one number is
    less than or equal to another: either observe that they are the
    same number, or give evidence that the first is less than or equal
    to the predecessor of the second. *)

  | le_S : forall n m, (le n m) -> (le n (S m)).

Notation "m <= n" := (le m n).

(** Proofs of facts about [<=] using the constructors [le_n] and
    [le_S] follow the same patterns as proofs about properties, like
    [ev] above. We can [apply] the constructors to prove [<=]
    goals (e.g., to show that [3<=3] or [3<=6]), and we can use
    tactics like [inversion] to extract information from [<=]
    hypotheses in the context (e.g., to prove that [(2 <= 1) ->
    2+2=5].) *)

(** Here are some sanity checks on the definition.  (Notice that,
    although these are the same kind of simple "unit tests" as we gave
    for the testing functions we wrote in the first few lectures, we
    must construct their proofs explicitly -- [simpl] and
    [reflexivity] don't do the job, because the proofs aren't just a
    matter of simplifying computations.) *)
