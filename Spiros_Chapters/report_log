for Tuesday 11/27:

things I worked on last week:
- the evaluation function for simplifying terms made of 0's and 1's, 
e.g. the multipliation and the addition function
- adding feautres to Lowenheim's base formula, the check_correct input function
and the ability of the function to take multiple ground solutions and produce multiple unifiers

Problems and things to work on:
- github problem, I am kind of stuck on a branch I pulled and I have tried several ways to undo it, but it's hard
- add more example with lowenheim's new formula
- potential feauture, lowenheim finds its ground solutions by itself
- look more into the proof, the definition of mgu and "more general unfier"
