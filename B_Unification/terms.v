(** * Introduction **)

(** In order for any proofs to be constructed in Coq, we need to formally define
    the logic and data across which said proofs will operate. Since the heart of
    our analysis is concerned with the unification of Boolean equations, it
    stands to reason that we should articulate precisely how algebra functions
    with respect to Boolean rings. To attain this, we shall formalize what an
    equation looks like, how it can be composed inductively, and also how
    substitutions behave when applied to equations. *)

(** * Terms **)

(** ** Definitions **)

(** We shall now begin describing the rules of Boolean arithmetic as well as the
    nature of Boolean equations. For simplicity's sake, from now on we shall be
    referring to equations as terms. *)

(*  Define a variable to be a natural number *)
Definition var := nat.

Definition var_eq_dec := Nat.eq_dec.

(** A _term_, as has already been previously described, is now inductively
    declared to hold either a constant value, a single variable, a sum of terms,
    or a product of terms. *)

Inductive term: Type :=
  | T0  : term
  | T1  : term
  | VAR  : var -> term
  | SUM : term -> term -> term
  | PRODUCT : term -> term -> term.

(** For convenience's sake, we define some shorthanded notation for readability.
    *)

Implicit Types x y z : term.
Implicit Types n m : var.

Notation "x + y" := (SUM x y) (at level 50, left associativity).
Notation "x * y" := (PRODUCT x y) (at level 40, left associativity).

(** ** Axioms *)

(** Now that we have informed Coq on the nature of what a term is, it is now
    time to propose a set of axioms that will articulate exactly how algebra
    behaves across Boolean rings. This is a requirement since the very act of
    unifying an equation is intimately related to solving it algebraically. Each
    of the axioms proposed below describe the rules of Boolean algebra precisely
    and in an unambiguous manner. None of these should come as a surprise to the
    reader; however, if one is not familiar with this form of logic, the rules
    regarding the summation and multiplication of identical terms might pose as
    a source of confusion.

    For reasons of keeping Coq's internal logic consistent, we roll our own
    custom equivalence relation as opposed to simply using "=". This will
    provide a surefire way to avoid any odd errors from later cropping up in our
    proofs. Of course, by doing this we introduce some implications that we will
    need to address later. *)

Parameter eqv : term -> term -> Prop.

(**  Here we introduce some special notation for term equivalence *)

Infix " == " := eqv (at level 70).

(** Below is the set of fundamental axioms concerning the equivalence " == " relation. 
    They form the boolean ring (or system) on which Lowenheim's formula and proof are developed.

    Most of these axioms will appear familiar to anyone; however, certain ones such as the 
    summation of two identical terms are true only across Boolean rings and as such might 
    appear strange at first glance.
*)

Axiom sum_comm : forall x y, x + y == y + x.

Axiom sum_assoc : forall x y z, (x + y) + z == x + (y + z).

Axiom sum_id : forall x, T0 + x == x. 

(**  Across boolean rings, the summation of two terms will always be 0 because there
     are only two elements in the ring: 0 and 1. For this reason, the mapping of 1 + 1 has
     nowhere else to go besides 0. *)

Axiom sum_x_x : forall x, x + x == T0.

Axiom mul_comm : forall x y, x * y == y * x.

Axiom mul_assoc : forall x y z, (x * y) * z == x * (y * z).

(**  Across bollean rings, the multiplication of two identical terms will always be 
     the same as just having one instance of said term. This is because 0 * 0 = 0 and
     1 * 1 = 1 as one would expect normally. *)

Axiom mul_x_x : forall x, x * x == x.

Axiom mul_T0_x : forall x, T0 * x == T0.

Axiom mul_id : forall x, T1 * x == x.

Axiom distr : forall x y z, x * (y + z) == (x * y) + (x * z).

(** Any axioms beyond this point of the development are not considered part of
the 'fundamental axiom system',but they still need to exist for the development and proofs 
to hold. *)

(*  Across all equations, adding an expression to both sides does not
   break the equivalence of the relation *)
Axiom term_sum_symmetric :
  forall x y z, x == y <-> x + z == y + z.

Axiom refl_comm :
  forall t1 t2, t1 == t2 -> t2 == t1.

Axiom T1_not_equiv_T0 :
  ~(T1 == T0).

Hint Resolve sum_comm sum_assoc sum_x_x sum_id distr
             mul_comm mul_assoc mul_x_x mul_T0_x mul_id.

(** Now that the core axioms have been taken care of, we need to handle the
    implications posed by our custom equivalence relation. Below we inform Coq
    of the behavior of our equivalence relation with respect to reflexivity, symmetry, and 
    transitivity in order to allow for rewrites during the construction of proofs operating across our
    new equivalence relation. *)

(*  Mundane coq magic for custom equivalence relation *)
Axiom eqv_ref : Reflexive eqv.
Axiom eqv_sym : Symmetric eqv.
Axiom eqv_trans : Transitive eqv.

Add Parametric Relation : term eqv
  reflexivity proved by @eqv_ref
  symmetry proved by @eqv_sym
  transitivity proved by @eqv_trans
  as eq_set_rel.

Axiom SUM_compat :
  forall x x', x == x' ->
  forall y y', y == y' ->
    (x + y) == (x' + y').

Axiom PRODUCT_compat :
  forall x x', x == x' ->
  forall y y', y == y' ->
    (x * y) == (x' * y').

Add Parametric Morphism : SUM with
  signature eqv ==> eqv ==> eqv as SUM_mor.
Proof.
exact SUM_compat.
Qed.

Add Parametric Morphism : PRODUCT with
  signature eqv ==> eqv ==> eqv as PRODUCT_mor.
Proof.
exact PRODUCT_compat.
Qed.

Hint Resolve eqv_ref eqv_sym eqv_trans SUM_compat PRODUCT_compat.

(** ** Lemmas **)

(** Since Coq now understands the basics of Boolean algebra, it serves as a good
    exercise for us to generate some further rules using Coq's proving systems.
    By doing this, not only do we gain some additional tools that will become
    handy later down the road, but we also test whether our axioms are behaving
    as we would like them to. *)

(*  Lemma for a sub-case of term multiplication. *)
Lemma mul_x_x_plus_T1 :
  forall x, x * (x + T1) == T0.

  intros. rewrite distr. rewrite mul_x_x. rewrite mul_comm.
  rewrite mul_id. apply sum_x_x.

(*  Lemma to convert term equivalence to equivalence between their
    addition and ground term T0, and vice-versa. *)

Qed.

Hint Resolve mul_x_x_plus_T1 x_equal_y_x_plus_y.

(** These lemmas just serve to make certain rewrites regarding the core axioms
    less tedious to write. While one could certainly argue that they should be
    formulated as axioms and not lemmas due to their triviality, being pedantic
    is a good exercise. *)

Qed.

(** * Variable Sets **)

(** Now that the underlying behavior concerning Boolean algebra has been
    properly articulated to Coq, it is now time to begin formalizing the logic
    surrounding our meta reasoning of Boolean equations and systems. While there
    are certainly several approaches to begin this process, we thought it best
    to ease into things through formalizing the notion of a set of variables
    present in an equation. *)

(** ** Definitions **)

(** We now define a _variable set_ to be precisely a list of variables;
    additionally, we include several functions for including and excluding
    variables from these variable sets. Furthermore, since uniqueness is not a
    property guaranteed by Coq lists and it has the potential to be desirable,
    we define a function that consumes a variable set and removes duplicate
    entries from it. For convenience, we also provide several examples to
    demonstrate the functionalities of these new definitions. *)

(**  Here is a definition of the new type to represent a list (set) of variables (natural numbers) *)

Definition var_set := list var.
Implicit Type vars: var_set.

(**  A simple function to check to see if a variable is in a variable set *)
Fixpoint var_set_includes_var (v : var) (vars : var_set) : bool :=
  match vars with
    | nil => false
    | n :: n' => if (beq_nat v n) then true
                                  else var_set_includes_var v n'
  end.

(**  A function to remove all instances of var v from a list of vars *)
Fixpoint var_set_remove_var (v : var) (vars : var_set) : var_set :=
  match vars with
    | nil => nil
    | n :: n' => if (beq_nat v n) then (var_set_remove_var v n')
                                  else n :: (var_set_remove_var v n')
  end.

(**  Function to return a unique var_set without duplicates. Found_vars should be
    empty for correctness guarantee *)
Fixpoint var_set_create_unique (vars : var_set): var_set :=
  match vars with
    | nil => nil
    | n :: n' => 
    if (var_set_includes_var n n') then var_set_create_unique n'
                                   else n :: var_set_create_unique n'
  end.

(**  Function to check if a given var_set is unique *)
Fixpoint var_set_is_unique (vars : var_set): bool :=
  match vars with
    | nil => true
    | n :: n' => 
    if (var_set_includes_var n n') then false
                                   else var_set_is_unique n'
  end.

(**  Function to get the variables of a term as a var_set *)
Fixpoint term_vars (t : term) : var_set :=
  match t with
    | T0 => nil
    | T1 => nil
    | VAR x => x :: nil
    | PRODUCT x y => (term_vars x) ++ (term_vars y)
    | SUM x y => (term_vars x) ++ (term_vars y)
  end.

(** Function to generate a list of unique variables that make up a given term *)
Definition term_unique_vars (t : term) : var_set :=
  var_set_create_unique (term_vars t).

(** ** Lemmas *)

(** Now that we have established the functionality for variable sets, let us prove some properties about them.

(** * Ground Terms **)

(** Seeing as we just outlined the definition of a variable set, it seems fair
    to now formalize the definition of a ground term, or in other words, a term
    that has no variables and whose variable set is the empty set. *)

(** ** Definitions **)

(** A _ground term_ is a recursively defined proposition that is only true if
    and only if no variable appears in it; otherwise it will be a false
    proposition and no longer a ground term. *)

(*  In this subsection we declare definitions related to ground terms, inluding
    functions and lemmas *)

(**  Function to check if a given term is a ground term (i.e. has no vars) *)
Fixpoint ground_term (t : term) : Prop :=
  match t with
    | VAR x => False
    | SUM x y => ground_term x /\ ground_term y
    | PRODUCT x y => ground_term x /\ ground_term y
    | _ => True
  end.

(** ** Lemmas **)

(** Our first real lemma (shown below), articulates an important property of
    ground terms: all ground terms are equvialent to either [0] or [1]. This
    curious property is a direct result of the fact that these terms possess no
    variables and additioanlly because of the axioms of Boolean algebra. *)

(**  Lemma (trivial, intuitively true) that proves that if the function
    ground_term returns true then it is either T0 or T1 *)
Lemma ground_term_equiv_T0_T1 :
  forall x, ground_term x -> x == T0 \/ x == T1.

    reflexivity. rewrite H2. rewrite H3. right. rewrite mul_id. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** This lemma, while intuitively obvious by definition, nonetheless provides a
    formal bridge between the world of ground terms and the world of variable
    sets. *)

Lemma ground_term_has_empty_var_set :
  forall x, (ground_term x) -> (term_vars x) = [].
Proof.
  intros. induction x.
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - contradiction.
  - firstorder. unfold term_vars. unfold term_vars in H2. rewrite H2.

  - firstorder. unfold term_vars. unfold term_vars in H2. rewrite H2.
    unfold term_vars in H1. rewrite H1. simpl. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** ** Examples **)

(** Here are some examples to show that our ground term definition is working
    appropriately. *)

Example ex_gt1 :
  ground_term (T0 + T1).
Proof.
  simpl. split.
  - reflexivity.
  - reflexivity.
Qed.

Example ex_gt2 :
  ground_term (VAR 0 * T1) -> False.
Proof.
  simpl. intros. destruct H. apply H.
Qed.

(** * Substitutions **)

(** It is at this point in our Coq development that we begin to officially
    define the principal action around which the entirety of our efforts are
    centered: the act of substituting variables with other terms. While
    substitutions alone are not of great interest, their emergent properties as
    in the case of whether or not a given substitution unifies an equation are
    of substantial importance to our later research. *)

(** ** Definitions **)

(** In this subsection we make the fundamental definitions of substitutions,
    basic functions for them, accompanying lemmas and some propsitions. *)

(** Here we define a _substitution_ to be a list of ordered pairs where each
    pair represents a variable being mapped to a term. For sake of clarity these
    ordered pairs shall be referred to as _replacements_ from now on and as a
    result, substitutions should really be considered to be lists of
    replacements. *)

Definition replacement := prod var term.

(*  We define a new type susbt to represent a substitution as a list of
    replacements *)
Definition subst := list replacement.

Implicit Type s : subst.

(** Our first function, [find_replacement], is an auxilliary to [apply_subst].
    This function will search through a substitution for a specific variable,
    and if found, returns the variable's associated term. *)

Fixpoint find_replacement (x : var) (s : subst) : term :=
  match s with
  | nil => VAR x
  | r :: r' =>
      if beq_nat (fst r) x then snd r
                           else find_replacement x r'
  end.

(** The [apply_subst] function will take a term and a substitution and will
    produce a new term reflecting the changes made to the original one. *)

Fixpoint apply_subst (t : term) (s : subst) : term :=
  match t with
  | T0 => T0
  | T1 => T1
  | VAR x => find_replacement x s
  | PRODUCT x y => PRODUCT (apply_subst x s) (apply_subst y s)
  | SUM x y => SUM (apply_subst x s) (apply_subst y s)
  end.

(** For reasons of completeness, it is useful to be able to generate _identity
    substitutions_; namely, substitutions that map the variables of a term to
    themselves. *)

(*  function that given a list of variables, it build a list of identical
    substitutions - one for each variable *)
Fixpoint build_id_subst (lvar : var_set) : subst :=
  match lvar with
  | nil => nil
  | v :: v' => (v , (VAR v)) :: build_id_subst v'
  end.

(** Since we now have the ability to generate identity substitutions, we should
    now formalize a general proposition for testing whether or not a given
    substitution is an identity substitution of a given term. *)

Definition subst_equiv (s1 s2: subst) : Prop :=
  forall t, apply_subst t s1 == apply_subst t s2.

Definition subst_is_id_subst (t : term) (s : subst) : Prop :=
  apply_subst t s == t.

(** Given we now have definitions for substitutions, we should now introduce the idea of a 
    substitution composing another one *)

Fixpoint subst_compose (s s' : subst) : subst :=
  match s' with
    | [] => s
    | (x, t) :: s'' => (x, apply_subst t s) :: (subst_compose s s'')
  end.

(* Defining the domain of a substituion, namely the list of variables for which
the substitution has a mapping (replacement). Essentially this acts as a list of all the first
parts of the replacement.
*)

Definition subst_domain (sig : subst) : list var :=
 map (fun r => (fst r)) sig.


(* Defining a sub list. If an element is a member of a list,
it is then a member of the other list as well. 
*)

Definition sub_dmn_list (l1 : list var) (l2 : list var) : Prop :=
 forall (x : var), In x l1 -> In x l2.

(** ** Lemmas **)

(** Having now outlined the functionality of a subsitution, let us now begin to
    analyze some implications of its form and composition by proving some
    lemmas. *)

(** Given that we have a definition for identity substitutions, we should prove
    that identity substitutions do not modify a term. *)

Lemma id_subst: forall (t : term) (l : var_set),
  apply_subst t (build_id_subst l) == t.

(** * Unification **)

(** Now that we have established the concept of term substitutions in Coq, it is
    time for us to formally define the concept of Boolean unification.
    _Unification_, in its most literal sense, refers to the act of applying a
    substitution to terms in order to make them equivalent to each other. In
    other words, to say that two terms are _unifiable_ is to really say that
    there exists a substitution such that the two terms are equal. Interestingly
    enough, we can abstract this concept further to simply saying that a single
    term is unifiable if there exists a substitution such that the term will be
    equivalent to [0]. By doing this abstraction, we can prove that equation
    solving and unification are essentially the same fundamental problem. *)

(** Below is the initial definition for unification, namely that two terms can
    be unified to be equivalent to one another. By starting here we will show
    each step towards abstracting unification to refer to a single term. *)

(*  Proposition that a given substitution unifies (namely, makes equivalent),
    two given terms *)
Definition unifies (a b : term) (s : subst) : Prop :=
  apply_subst a s == apply_subst b s.

(** Here is a simple example demonstrating the concept of testing whether two
    terms are unified by a substitution. *)

(*  Examples that prove the correctness of the unifies definition *)

  unifies (VAR 0) (VAR 1) [(0, T1); (1, T1)].
Proof.
  unfold unifies. simpl. reflexivity.

(** Now we are going to show that moving both terms to one side of the
    equivalence relation through addition does not change the concept of
    unification. *)

    when the substitution is applied to each of them, and ground term T0 *)
Definition unifies_T0 (a b : term) (s : subst) : Prop :=

(*  Lemma that proves that finding a unifier for x = y is the same as finding a

    that unifies it. *)

(** * Most General Unifier **)

(** In this subsection we define propositions, lemmas and examples related to
    the most general unifier. *)

(** While the property of a term being unifiable is certainly important, it
    should come as no surprise that not all unifiers are created equal; in fact,
    certain unifiers possess the desirable property of being _more general_ than
    others. For this reason, let us now formally define the concept of a _most
    general unifier_ (mgu): a unifier such that with respect to a given term,
    all other unifiers are instances of it, or in other words, less general than
    it. *)

(** The first step towards establishing the concept of a mgu requires us to
    formalize the notion of a unifier being more general than another. To
    accomplish this goal, let us formulate the definition of a substitution
    composing another one; or in other words, to say that a substitution is more
    general than another one. *)

(**  Proposition of sequential substition application *)
Definition substitution_factor_through (s s' delta : subst) : Prop :=
  forall (x : var), apply_subst (apply_subst (VAR x) s) delta ==
                    apply_subst (VAR x) s' .

(** Definition of a more general unifier *)
Definition more_general_substitution (s s': subst) : Prop :=
  exists delta, substitution_factor_through s s' delta .

(** Now that we have articulated the concept of composing substitutions, let us
    now formulate the definition for a most general unifier. *)

(** Definition of a Most General Unifier (mgu) : A Most General Unifier (MGU) takes in a term and a substitution and tells
    whether or not said substitution is an mgu for the given term. *)
Definition most_general_unifier (t : term) (s : subst) : Prop :=
  unifier t s /\
  forall (s' : subst),
  unifier t s' ->
  more_general_substitution s s'.

(** While this definition of a most general unifier is certainly valid, it is a
    somewhat unwieldy formulation. For this reason, let us now define an
    alternative definition called a _reproductive unifier_, and then prove it to
    be equivalent to our definition of a most general unifier. This will make
    our proofs easier to formulate down the road as the task of proving a
    unifier to be reproductive is substantially easier than proving it to be
    most general directly. *)

Definition reproductive_unifier (t : term) (sig : subst) : Prop :=
  unifier t sig /\
  forall (tau : subst) (x : var),
  unifier t tau ->
  apply_subst (apply_subst (VAR x) sig ) tau == apply_subst (VAR x) tau.

(** Lemma to show that a reproductive unifier is a most general unifier.
Since the ultimate goal is to prove that a specific algorithm produces an mgu
then if we could prove it is a reproductive unifier  then we could use this lemma
to arrive at the desired conclusion.

(** An intuitive lemma that states when a term is equivalent to T0 and it is also 
a ground term then simplifying it gives a term exactly equal to T0. This intitutively follows
from the fact that since _t_ is a ground term then all its terms are either T0 or T1 and since 
it is equivalent to T0, simplifying it will also give a single final ground term T0.

Lemma simplify_eq_T0 :
 forall (t : term),
 t == T0 /\ (is_ground_term t) = true ->
 (simplify t) = T0.
Proof.
