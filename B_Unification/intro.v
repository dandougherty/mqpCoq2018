(** * Unification *)


(** Before defining what unification is, there is some terminology to understand.
    A _term_ is either a variable or a function applied to terms. By this
    definition, a constant term is just a nullary function. A _variable_ is a 
    symbol capable of taking on the value of any term. An examples of a term is
    [f(a, x)], where [f] is a function of two arguments, [a] is a constant, and
    [x] is a variable. A term is _ground_ if no variables occur in it. The last
    example is not a ground term but [f(a, a)] would be.
*)

(** A _substitution_ is a mapping from variables to terms. The _domain_ of a
    substitution is the set of variables that do not get mapped to themselves.
    The _range_ is the set of terms the are mapped to by the domain. It is common
    for substitutions to be referred to as mappings from terms to terms. A
    substitution [s] can be extended to this form by defining [s'(u)] for two
    cases of [u]. If [u] is a variable, then [s'(u) = s(u)]. If [u] is a function
    [f(u1, ..., un)], then [s'(u) = f(s'(u1), ..., s'(un))].
*)

(** Unification is the process of solving a set of equations between two terms.
    The set of equations is referred to as a unification problem.
    The process of solving one of these problems can be classified by the set of
    terms considered and the equality of any two terms. The latter
    property is what distinguishes two broad groups of algorithms, namely
    syntactic and semantic unification. If two terms are only considered equal if
    they are identical, then the unification is syntactic. If two terms are equal
    with respect to an equational theory, then the unification is semantic.
*)

(** The goal of unification is to solve equations, which means to produce a
    substitution that unifies those equations. A substitution [s] _unifies_ an
    equation [u =? v] if applying [s] to both sides makes them equal
    [s(u) = s(v)]. In this case, we call [s] a _solution_ or _unifier_.
*)

(** The goal of a unification algorithm is not just to produce a unifier but to 
    produce one that is most general. A substitution is a _most general unifier_ 
    or _mgu_ of a problem if it is more general than every other solution to the 
    problem. A substitution [s] is more general than [s'] if there exists a third
    substitution [t] such that [s'(u) = t(s(u)] for any term [u].
