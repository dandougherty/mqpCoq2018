(** * Intro *)

(** Here we implement the algorithm for successive variable elimination. The
    basic idea is to remove a variable from the problem, solve that simpler 
    problem, and build a solution from the simpler solution. The algorithm is
    recursive, so variables are removed and problems generated until we are left
    with either of two problems; 1 =B 0 or 0 =B 0. In the former case, the whole
    original problem is not unifiable. In the latter case, the problem is solved
    without any need to substitute since there are no variables. From here, we
    begin the process of building up substitutions until we reach the original
    problem. *)

(** * Eliminating Variables *)

(** This section deals with the problem of removing a variable [x] from a term
    [t]. The first thing to notice is that [t] can be written in polynomial form
    [p]. This polynomial is just a set of monomials, and each monomial a set of
    variables. We can now seperate the polynomials into two sets [qx] and [r].
    The term [qx] will be the set of monomials in [p] that contain the variable
    [x]. The term [q], or the quotient, is [qx] with the [x] removed from each
    monomial. The term [r], or the remainder, will be the monomials that do not
    contain [x]. The original term can then be written as [x * q + r]. *)

(** Implementing this procedure is pretty straightforward. We define a function
    [div_by_var] that produces two polynomials given a polynomial [p] and a
    variable [x] to eliminate from it. The first step is dividing [p] into [qx]
    and [r] which is performed using a partition over [p] with the predicate
    [has_var]. The second step is to remove [x] from [qx] using the helper 
    [elim_var] which just maps over the given polynomial removing the given 
    variable. *)

Definition has_var (x : var) := existsb (beq_nat x).

Definition elim_var (x : var) (p : poly) : poly :=
  map (remove var_eq_dec x) p.

Definition div_by_var (x : var) (p : poly) : pair poly :=
  let (qx, r) := partition (has_var x) p in
  (elim_var x qx, r).


(** We would also like to prove some lemmas about varaible elimination that
    will be helpful in proving the full algorithm correct later. The main lemma
    below is [decomp_eq], which just asserts that after eliminating [x] from [p]
    into [q] and [r] the term can be put back together as in [p = x * q + r].
    This fact turns out to be rather hard to prove and needs the help of 10 or
    so other sudsidiary lemmas. *)

(** The second main lemma about varaible elimination is below. Given that a term
    [p] has been decomposed into the form [x * q + r], we can define [p' = (q +
    1) * r]. The lemma [decomp_unif] states that any unifier of [p =B 0] is also
    a unifier of [p' =B 0]. Much of this proof relies on the axioms of
    polynomial arithmetic. *)
