(** * Introduction *)

(** Here we implement the algorithm for successive variable elimination. The
    basic idea is to remove a variable from the problem, solve that simpler
    problem, and build a solution from the simpler solution. The algorithm is
    recursive, so variables are removed and problems are generated until we are
    left with either of two problems; $1 \stackrel{?}{\approx}_{B} 0$ or
    $0 \stackrel{?}{\approx}_{B} 0$. In the former case, the whole original
    problem is not unifiable. In the latter case, the problem is solved without
    any need to substitute since there are no variables. From here, we begin the
    process of building up substitutions until we reach the original problem. *)


(** * Eliminating Variables *)

(** This section deals with the problem of removing a variable [x] from a term
    _t_. The first thing to notice is that _t_ can be written in polynomial form
    $t\downarrow_{P}$. This polynomial is just a set of monomials, and each
    monomial a set of variables. We can now seperate the polynomials into two
    sets [qx] and [r]. The term [qx] will be the set of monomials in
    $t\downarrow_{P}$ that contain the variable [x]. The term [q], or the
    quotient, is [qx] with the [x] removed from each monomial. The term [r], or
    the remainder, will be the monomials in $t\downarrow_{P}$ that do not
    contain [x]. The original term can then be written as $x \ast q + r$. *)

(** Implementing this procedure is pretty straightforward. We define a function
    [div_by_var] that produces two polynomials given a polynomial [p] and a
    variable [x] to eliminate from it. The first step is dividing [p] into [qx]
    and [r] which is performed using a partition over [p] with the predicate
    [has_var]. The second step is to remove [x] from [qx] using the helper
    [elim_var]. *)

(** The function [has_var] determines whether a variable appears in a monomial.
    *)

Definition has_var (x : var) := existsb (beq_nat x).

(** The function [elim_var] removes a variable from each monomial in a
    polynomial. It is possible that this leaves the term not in polynomial form
    so it is then repaired with [make_poly]. *)

Definition elim_var (x : var) (p : poly) : poly :=
  make_poly (map (remove var_eq_dec x) p).

(** The function [div_by_var] produces a quotient [q] and remainder [r] from a
    polynomial [p] and variable [x] such that $p \approx_{B} x \ast q + r$ and
    [x] does not occur in [r]. *)

Definition div_by_var (x : var) (p : poly) : prod poly poly :=
  let (qx, r) := partition (has_var x) p in
  (elim_var x qx, r).


(** We would also like to prove some lemmas about varaible elimination that
    will be helpful in proving the full algorithm correct later. The main lemma
    below is [div_eq], which just asserts that after eliminating [x] from [p]
    into [q] and [r] the term can be put back together as in
    $p \approx_{B} x \ast q + r$. This fact turns out to be rather hard to prove
    and needs the help of 10 or so other sudsidiary lemmas. *)


(** After eliminating a variable [x] from a polynomial to produdce [r], [x] does
    not occur in [r]. *)

(** The next four lemmas deal with the following scenario: Let [p] be a term in
    polynomial form, [x] be a variable that occurs in each monomial of [p], and
    [r = elim_var x p]. *)

(** The term [r] is a permutation of removing [x] from [p]. Another way of
    looking at this statement is when [elim_var] repairs the term produced from
    removing a variable it only sorts that term. *)

(** The term $(x \ast r)\downarrow_{P}$ is a permutation of the result of
    removing [x] from [p], appending [x] to the end of each monomial, and

    lemma from the [poly] library, which has a simpler goal but does much of the
    heavy lifting. *)

(** * Recursive Algorithm *)

(** Now we define the actual algorithm of successive variable elimination.
    Built using five helper functions, the definition is not too difficult to
    construct or understand. The general idea, as mentioned before, is to remove
    one variable at a time, creating simpler problems. Once the simplest problem
    has been reached, to which the solution is already known, every solution to
    each subproblem can be built from the solution to the successive subproblem.
    Formally, given the polynomials $p = (x \ast q + r)\downarrow_{P}$ and
    $p' = ((q + 1) * r)\downarrow_{P}$, the solution to
    $p \stackrel{?}{\approx}_{B} 0$ is built from the solution to
    $p' \stackrel{?}{\approx}_{B} 0$. If $\sigma$ solves
    $p' \stackrel{?}{\approx}_{B} 0$, then $\sigma \cup \{x \mapsto (x \ast
    (\sigma(q) + 1) + \sigma(r))\downarrow_{P}\}$ solves
    $p \stackrel{?}{\approx}_{B} 0$. *)

(** The function [sve] is the final result, but it is [sveVars] which actually
    has all of the meat. Due to Coq's rigid type system, every recursive
    function must be obviously terminating. This means that one of the arguments
    must decrease with each nested call. It turns out that Coq's type checker
    is unable to deduce that continually building polynomials from the quotient
    and remainder of previous ones will eventually result in [0] or [1]. So
    instead we add a fuel argument that explicitly decreases per recursive call.
    We use the set of variables in the polynomial for this purpose, since each
    subsequent call has at least one less variable. *)

Fixpoint sveVars (varlist : list var) (p : poly) : option subst :=
  match varlist with
  | [] => 
      match p with
      | [] => Some [] (* p = 0, Identity substitution *)
      | _  => None    (* p = 1, No solution *)
      end
  | x :: xs =>
      let (q, r) := div_by_var x p in
      let p' := (build_poly q r) in
      match sveVars xs p' with
      | None => None
      | Some s => Some (build_subst s x q r)
      end
  end.

(** The function [sve] simply calls [sveVars] with an initial fuel of [vars p].
    *)

Definition sve (p : poly) : option subst := sveVars (vars p) p.



(** * Correctness *)

(** Finally, we must show that this algorithm is correct. As discussed in the
    beginning, the correctness of a unification algorithm is proven for two
    cases. If the algorithm produces a solution for a problem, then the solution
    must be most general. If the algorithm produces no solution, then the
    problem must be not unifiable. These statements have been formalized in the
    theorem [sve_correct] with the help of the predicates [mgu] and [unifiable]
    as defined in the library [poly_unif]. The two cases of the proof are
    handled seperately by the lemmas [sveVars_some] and [sveVars_none].

(** If [sveVars] produces a substitution $\sigma$, then the range of $\sigma$
    only contains polynomials. *)
