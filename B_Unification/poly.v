(** * Introduction *)

(** Another way of representing the terms of a unification problem is as polynomials 
    and monomials. A monomial is a set of variables multiplied together, and a polynomial 
    is a set of monomials added together. By following the ten axioms set forth in 
    B-unification, we can transform any term to this form. 

    Since one of the rules is x * x = x, we can guarantee that there are no repeated 
    variables in any given monomial. Similarly, because x + x = 0, we can guarantee 
    that there are no repeated monomials in a polynomial. Because of these properties, as 
    well as the commutativity of addition and multiplication, we can represent both 
    monomials and polynomials as unordered sets of variables and monomials, respectively. 
    This file serves to implement such a representation.  
  *)



(* ===== Polynomial Representation - Data Types ===== *)
(** * Monomials and Polynomials *)
(** ** Data Type Definitions *)
(** A monomial is simply a list of variables, with variables as defined in terms.v. *)

Definition mono := list var.

(** A polynomial, then, is a list of monomials. *)

Definition poly := list mono.

(** ** Comparisons of monomials and polynomials *)
(** 
    For the sake of simplicity when comparing monomials and polynomials, we have opted
    for a solution that maintains the lists as sorted. This allows us to simultaneously
    ensure that there are no duplicates, as well as easily comparing the sets with the 
    standard Coq equals operator over lists.

    Ensuring that a list of nats is sorted is easy enough. In order to compare lists of
    sorted lists, we'll need the help of another function: 
  *)

Fixpoint lex {T : Type} (cmp : T -> T -> comparison) (l1 l2 : list T)
              : comparison :=
  match l1, l2 with
  | [], [] => Eq
  | [], _ => Lt
  | _, [] => Gt
  | h1 :: t1, h2 :: t2 =>
      match cmp h1 h2 with
      | Eq => lex cmp t1 t2
      | c => c
      end
  end.

(** 
    There are some important but relatively straightforward properties of this function
    that are useful to prove. First, reflexivity: 
  *)

Theorem lex_nat_refl : forall (l : list nat), lex compare l l = Eq.
Proof.
  intros.
  induction l.
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - simpl. rewrite compare_refl. apply IHl.
Qed.

(** 
    Next, antisymmetry. This allows us to take a predicate or hypothesis about the 
    comparison of two polynomials and reverse it. For example, a < b implies b > a.
  *)

Theorem lex_nat_antisym : forall (l1 l2 : list nat),
  lex compare l1 l2 = CompOpp (lex compare l2 l1).
Proof.
  intros l1.
  induction l1.
  - intros. simpl. destruct l2; reflexivity.
  - intros. simpl. destruct l2.
    + simpl. reflexivity.
    + simpl. destruct (a ?= n) eqn:H;
      rewrite compare_antisym in H;
      rewrite CompOpp_iff in H; simpl in H;
      rewrite H; simpl.
      * apply IHl1.
      * reflexivity.
      * reflexivity.
Qed.

Lemma lex_eq : forall n m,
  lex compare n m = Eq <-> lex compare m n = Eq.
Proof.
  intros n m. split; intro; rewrite lex_nat_antisym in H; unfold CompOpp in H.
  - destruct (lex compare m n) eqn:H0; inversion H. reflexivity.
  - destruct (lex compare n m) eqn:H0; inversion H. reflexivity.
Qed.

Lemma lex_lt_gt : forall n m,
  lex compare n m = Lt <-> lex compare m n = Gt.
Proof.
  intros n m. split; intro; rewrite lex_nat_antisym in H; unfold CompOpp in H.
  - destruct (lex compare m n) eqn:H0; inversion H. reflexivity.
  - destruct (lex compare n m) eqn:H0; inversion H. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** 
    Lastly is a property over lists. The comparison of two lists stays the same
    if the same new element is added onto the front of each list. Similarly, if
    the item at the front of two lists is equal, removing it from both does not
    chance the lists' comparison. 
  *)

Theorem lex_nat_cons : forall (l1 l2 : list nat) n,
  lex compare l1 l2 = lex compare (n::l1) (n::l2).
Proof.
  intros. simpl. rewrite compare_refl. reflexivity.
Qed.

Hint Resolve lex_nat_refl lex_nat_antisym lex_nat_cons.

(** ** Stronger Definitions *)
(** 
    Because as far as Coq is concerned any list of natural numbers is a monomial, 
    it is necessary to define a few more predicates about monomials and polynomials
    to ensure our desired properties hold. Using these in proofs will prevent any
    random list from being used as a monomial or polynomial.
  *)

(** Monomials are simply sorted lists of natural numbers. *)

Definition is_mono (m : mono) : Prop := Sorted lt m.

(** Polynomials are sorted lists of lists, where all of the lists in the polynomail
    are monomials. *)

Definition is_poly (p : poly) : Prop :=
  Sorted (fun m n => lex compare m n = Lt) p /\ forall m, In m p -> is_mono m.

Hint Unfold is_mono is_poly.

Definition vars (p : poly) : list var :=
  nodup var_eq_dec (concat p).

(** There are a few userful things we can prove about these definitions too. First, 
    every element in a monomial is guaranteed to be less than the elements after it. *)

Lemma mono_order : forall x y m,
  is_mono (x :: y :: m) ->
  x < y.
Proof.
  unfold is_mono.
  intros.
  apply Sorted_inv in H as [].
  apply HdRel_inv in H0.
  apply H0. 
Qed.

(** Similarly, if x :: m is a monomial, then m is also a monomial. *)

Lemma mono_cons : forall x m,
  is_mono (x :: m) ->
  is_mono m.
Proof.
  unfold is_mono.
  intros.
  apply Sorted_inv in H as [].
  apply H.
Qed.

(** The same properties hold for is_poly as well; any list in a polynomial is
    guaranteed to be less than the lists after it. *)

Lemma poly_order : forall m n p,
  is_poly (m :: n :: p) ->
  lex compare m n = Lt.
Proof.
  unfold is_poly.
  intros.
  destruct H.
  apply Sorted_inv in H as [].
  apply HdRel_inv in H1.
  apply H1.
Qed.

(** And if m :: p is a polynomial, we know both that p is a polynomial and that 
    m is a monomial. *)

Lemma poly_cons : forall m p,
  is_poly (m :: p) ->
  is_poly p /\ is_mono m.
Proof.
  unfold is_poly.
  intros.
  destruct H.
  apply Sorted_inv in H as [].
  split.
  - split.
    + apply H.
    + intros. apply H0, in_cons, H2.
  - apply H0, in_eq.
Qed.

(** Lastly, for completeness, nil is both a polynomial and monomial. *)

Lemma nil_is_mono :
  is_mono [].
Proof.
  auto.
Qed.

Lemma nil_is_poly :
  is_poly [].
Proof.
  unfold is_poly. split.
  - auto.
  - intro; contradiction.
