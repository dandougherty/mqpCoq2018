(** * Introduction *)

(** The second half of the project revolves around the successive variable 
    elimination algorithm for solving unification problems. While we could
    implement this algorithm with the same data structures used for Lowenheim's,
    this algorithm lends itself well to a new representation of terms as
    polynomials.

    A _polynomial_ is a list of monomials being added together, where a
    _monomial_ is a list of variables being multiplied together. Since one of
    the rules is that $x \ast x \approx_{B} x$, we can guarantee that there are
    no repeated variables in any given monomial. Similarly, because
    $x + x \approx_{B} 0$, we can guarantee that there are no repeated monomials
    in a polynomial.

    Because of these properties, as well as the commutativity of addition and
    multiplication, we can represent both monomials and polynomials as
    unordered sets of variables and monomials, respectively. For simplicity
    when implementing and comparing these polynomials in Coq, we have opted
    to use the standard list structure, instead maintaining that the lists
    are maintained in our polynomial form after each stage.

    In order to effectively implement polynomial lists in this way, a set of
    utilities are needed to allow us to easily perform operations on these
    lists. This file serves to implement and prove facts about these functions,
    as well as to expand upon the standard library when necessary. *)

(** * Comparisons Between Lists *)

(** Checking if a list of natural numbers is sorted is easy enough. Comparing
    lists of lists of nats is slightly harder, and requires the use of a new
    function, called [lex]. [lex] simply takes in a comparison and applies
    the comparison across the list until it finds a point where the elements
    are not equal.

    In all cases throughout this project, the comparator used will be the
    standard nat [compare] function.

    For example, [[1;2;3]] is less than [[1;2;4]], and [[1;2]] is greater than
    [[1]]. *)

Fixpoint lex {T : Type} (cmp : T -> T -> comparison) (l1 l2 : list T)
              : comparison :=
  match l1, l2 with
  | [], [] => Eq
  | [], _ => Lt
  | _, [] => Gt
  | h1 :: t1, h2 :: t2 =>
      match cmp h1 h2 with
      | Eq => lex cmp t1 t2
      | c => c
      end
  end.

(** There are some important but relatively straightforward properties of this
    function that are useful to prove. First, _reflexivity_: *)

Lemma lex_nat_refl : forall (l : list nat), lex compare l l = Eq.
Proof.
  intros.
  induction l.
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - simpl. rewrite compare_refl. apply IHl.
Qed.

(** Next, _antisymmetry_. This allows us to take a predicate or hypothesis about
    the comparison of two polynomials and reverse it.

    For example, [a < b] implies [b > a]. *)

Lemma lex_nat_antisym : forall (l1 l2 : list nat),
  lex compare l1 l2 = CompOpp (lex compare l2 l1).
Proof.
  intros l1.
  induction l1.
  - intros. simpl. destruct l2; reflexivity.

      rewrite H; simpl.
      * apply IHl1.
      * reflexivity.
      * reflexivity.
Qed.

(** It is also useful to convert from the result of [lex compare] to a
    hypothesis about equality in Coq. Clearly, if [lex compare] returns [Eq],
    the lists are exactly equal, and if it returns [Lt] or [Gt] they are not. *)

Lemma lex_eq : forall n m,
  lex compare n m = Eq <-> n = m.

  (lex compare n m = Gt -> n <> m).
Proof.
  intros n m. split.
  - intros. apply lex_neq. auto.
  - intros. apply lex_neq. auto.
Qed.

(** It is also useful to be able to flip the arguments of a call to
    [lex compare], since these two comparisons impact each other directly.

    If [lex compare] returns that [n = m], then this also means that [m = n].
    More interesting is that if [n < m], then [m > n]. *)

Lemma lex_rev_eq : forall n m,
  lex compare n m = Eq <-> lex compare m n = Eq.
Proof.
  intros n m. split; intro; rewrite lex_nat_antisym in H; unfold CompOpp in H.
  - destruct (lex compare m n) eqn:H0; inversion H. reflexivity.

Lemma lex_rev_lt_gt : forall n m,
  lex compare n m = Lt <-> lex compare m n = Gt.
Proof.
  intros n m. split; intro; rewrite lex_nat_antisym in H; unfold CompOpp in H.
  - destruct (lex compare m n) eqn:H0; inversion H. reflexivity.
  - destruct (lex compare n m) eqn:H0; inversion H. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Lastly is a property over lists. The comparison of two lists stays the same
    if the same new element is added onto the front of each list. Similarly, if
    the item at the front of two lists is equal, removing it from both does not
    change the lists' comparison. *)

Lemma lex_nat_cons : forall (l1 l2 : list nat) n,
  lex compare l1 l2 = lex compare (n::l1) (n::l2).
Proof.
  intros. simpl. rewrite compare_refl. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** * Extensions to the Standard Library *)

(** There were some facts about the standard library list functions that we
    found useful to prove, as they repeatedly came up in proofs of our more
    complex custom list functions.

    Specifically, because we are comparing sorted lists, it is often easier
    to disregard the sortedness of the lists and instead compare them as
    permutations of one another. As a result, many of the lemmas in the
    rest of this file revolve around proving that two lists are permutations
    of one another. *)

(** ** Facts about [In]  *)
(* ========== in ========== *)
(** First, a very simple fact about [In]. This mostly follows from the standard
    library lemma [Permutation_in], but is more convenient for some of our
    proofs when formalized like this. *)

Lemma Permutation_not_In : forall (A:Type) a (l l':list A),
  Permutation l l' ->
  ~ In a l ->
  ~ In a l'.
Proof.
  intros A a l l' H H0. intro. apply H0. apply Permutation_sym in H.
  apply (Permutation_in a) in H; auto.
Qed.

(** Something else that seems simple but proves very useful to know is that if
    there are no elements in a list, that list must be empty. *)

Lemma nothing_in_empty : forall {A} (l:list A),
  (forall a, ~ In a l) ->
  l = [].
Proof.
  intros A l H. destruct l; auto. pose (H a). simpl in n. exfalso.
  apply n. auto.
Qed.



(** ** Facts about [incl] *)
(* ========== incl ========== *)
(** Next are some useful lemmas about [incl]. First is that if one list is
    included in another, but one element of the second list is not in the first,
    then the first list is still included in the second with that element
    removed. *)

Lemma incl_not_in : forall A a (l m : list A),
  incl l (a :: m) ->
  ~ In a l ->
  incl l m.
Proof.
  intros A a l m Hincl Hnin. unfold incl in *. intros a0 Hin.
  simpl in Hincl. destruct (Hincl a0); auto. rewrite H in Hnin. contradiction.
Qed.

(** We also found it useful to relate [Permutation] to [incl]; if two lists are
    permutations of each other, then they must be set equivalent, or contain
    all of the same elements. *)

Lemma Permutation_incl : forall {A} (l m : list A),
  Permutation l m -> incl l m /\ incl m l.
Proof.
  intros A l m H. apply Permutation_sym in H as H0. split.
  + unfold incl. intros a. apply (Permutation_in _ H).
  + unfold incl. intros a. apply (Permutation_in _ H0).
Qed.

(** Unfortunately, the definition above cannot be changed into an iff
    relation, as [incl] proves nothing about the lengths of the lists. We can,
    however, prove that if some list [m] includes a list [l], then [m] includes
    all permutations of [l]. *)

Lemma incl_Permutation : forall {A:Type} (l l' m:list A),
  Permutation l l' ->
  incl l m ->
  incl l' m.
Proof.
  intros A l l' m H H0. apply Permutation_incl in H as [].
  apply incl_tran with (m:=l); auto.
Qed.

(** A really simple lemma is that if some list [l] is included in the empty
    list, then [l] must also be empty. *)

Lemma incl_nil : forall {X:Type} (l:list X),
  incl l [] <-> l = [].
Proof.
  intros X l. unfold incl. split; intro H.
  - destruct l; [auto | destruct (H x); intuition].
  - intros a Hin. destruct l; [auto | rewrite H in Hin; auto].
Qed.

(** The last fact about [incl] is simply a new way of formalizing the definition
    that is convenient for some proofs. *)

Lemma incl_cons_inv : forall (A:Type) (a:A) (l m : list A),
  incl (a :: l) m -> In a m /\ incl l m.
Proof.
  intros A a l m H. split.
  - unfold incl in H. apply H. intuition.
  - unfold incl in *. intros b Hin. apply H. intuition.
Qed.



(** ** Facts about [count_occ] *)
(* ========== count_occ ========== *)
(** Next is some facts about [count_occ]. Firstly, if two lists are permutations
    of each other, than every element in the first list has the same number of
    occurences in the second list. *)

Lemma count_occ_Permutation : forall (A:Type) Aeq_dec a (l l':list A),
  Permutation l l' ->
  count_occ Aeq_dec l a = count_occ Aeq_dec l' a.
Proof.
  intros A Aeq_dec a l l' H. induction H.
  - auto.
  - simpl. destruct (Aeq_dec x a); auto.
  - simpl. destruct (Aeq_dec y a); destruct (Aeq_dec x a); auto.
  - rewrite <- IHPermutation2. rewrite IHPermutation1. auto.
Qed.

(** The function [count_occ] also distributes over list concatenating, instead
    becoming addition. This is useful especially when dealing with count
    occurences of lists during induction. *)

Lemma count_occ_app : forall (A:Type) a (l m:list A) Aeq_dec,
  count_occ Aeq_dec (l++m) a = add (count_occ Aeq_dec l a) (count_occ Aeq_dec m a).
Proof.
  intros A a l m Aeq_dec. induction l.
  - simpl. auto.
  - simpl. destruct (Aeq_dec a0 a); simpl; auto.
Qed.

(** It is also convenient to reason about the relation between [count_occ] and
    [remove]. If the element being removed is the same as the one being counted,
    then the count is obviously [0]. If the elements are different, then the
    count is the same with or without the remove. *)

Lemma count_occ_remove : forall {A} Aeq_dec (a:A) p,
  count_occ Aeq_dec (remove Aeq_dec a p) a = 0.
Proof.
  intros A Aeq_dec a p. induction p.

(** ** Facts about [concat] *)
(* ========== concat ========== *)
(** Similarly to the lemma [Permutation_map], [Permutation_concat] shows that
    if two lists are permutations of each other then the flattening of each
    list are also permutations. *)

Lemma Permutation_concat : forall {A} (l m:list (list A)),
  Permutation l m ->

Qed.

(** Before the creation of this next lemma, it was relatively hard to reason
    about whether elements are in the flattening of a list of lists. This lemma
    states that if there is a list in the list of lists that contains the
    desired element, then that element will be in the flattened version. *)

Lemma In_concat_exists : forall (A:Type) ll (a:A),
  (exists l, In l ll /\ In a l) <-> In a (concat ll).
Proof.
  intros A ll a. split; intros H.

Qed.

(** This particular lemma is useful if the function being mapped returns a list
    of its input type. If the resulting lists are flattened after, then the
    result is the same as mapping the function without converting the output to
    lists. *)

Lemma concat_map : forall {A B:Type} (f:A->B) (l:list A),
  concat (map (fun a => [f a]) l) = map f l.
Proof.
  intros A B f l. induction l.

(** Another fact similar to the last is that if you flatten the result of
    mapping a function that maps a function over a list, we can rearrange the
    order of the [concat] and the [map]s. *)

Lemma concat_map_map : forall A B C l (f:B->C) (g:A->list B),

  map f (concat (map g l)).
Proof.

(** Lastly, if you [map] a function that converts every element of a list to
    [nil], and then [concat] the list of [nil]s, you end with [nil]. *)

Lemma concat_map_nil : forall {A} (p:list A),
  concat (map (fun x => []) p) = (@nil A).
Proof.

(** ** Facts about [Forall] and [existsb] *)

    the predicate [p] holds, then [p a] must be false for any element [a] of
    [l]. *)

Lemma existsb_false_forall : forall {A} p (l:list A),

(**
    And lastly, similarly to our other [Permutation] lemmas this far, if
    two lists were permutations of each other before [nodup] they are also
    permutations after.

    This lemma was slightly more complex than previous [Permutation] lemmas,
    but the proof is still very similar. It is solved by induction on the
    [Permutation] hypothesis. The first and last cases are trivial, and the
    second case (where we must prove [Permutation (x::l) (x::l')]) becomes
    simple with the use of Permutation_in.

    The last case (where we must show [Permutation (x::y::l) (y::x::l)])
    was slightly complicated by the fact that destructing [in_dec] gives us
    a hypothesis like [In x (y::l)], which seems useless in reasoning about
    the other list at first. However, by also destructing whether or not x
    and y are equal, we can easily prove this case as well

(** ** Facts about [partition] *)
(* ========== Partition =========== *) 
(**
    The final function in the standard library we found it useful to prove
    facts about is [partition]. First, we show the relation between
    [partition] and [filter]: filtering a list gives you a result that is
    equal to the first list [partition] would return. This lemma is proven
    one way, and then reformalized to be more useful in later proofs.
  *)

Lemma partition_filter_fst {X} p l :
  fst (partition p l) = @filter X p l.

(**
    We would like to be able to state a similar fact about the second list
    returned by [partition], but clearly these are all the elements "thrown out"
    by [filter]. Instead, we first create a simple definition for negating
    a function, and prove two quick facts about the relation between some [p]
    and [neg p].
  *)

Definition neg {X:Type} := fun (f:X->bool) => fun (a:X) => (negb (f a)).

  - destruct (p a); intuition.

(**
    With the addition of this [neg] proposition, we can now prove two lemmas
    relating the second [partition] list and [filter] in the same way we
    proved the lemmas about the first [partition] list.
  *)

Lemma partition_filter_snd {X} p l : 
  snd (partition p l) = @filter X (neg p) l.

(**
    These lemmas about [partition] and [filter] are now put to use in two
    important lemmas about [partition]. If some list [l] is partitioned into
    two lists [(t, f)], then every element in _t_ must return true for the
    filtering predicate and every element in [f] must return false.

(**
    Next is a rather obvious but useful lemma, which states that if a list [p]
    was split into [(l, r)] then appending these lists back together results
    in a list that is a permutation of the original.

(**
    The last and hardest fact about [partition] states that if the list being
    partitioned was already sorted, then the resulting two lists will also
    be sorted. This seems simple, as [partition] iterates through the elements
    in order and maintains the order in its children, but was surprisingly
    difficult to prove.

    After performing induction, the next step was to destruct [(f a)], to see
    which of the two lists the induction element would end up in. In both
    cases, the list that _doesn't_ receive the new element is already clearly
    sorted by the induction hypothesis, but proving the other one is sorted
    is slightly harder.

    By using [Forall_HdRel] (defined earlier), we reduced the problem in both
    cases to only having to show that the new element holds the relation [c]
    on all elements of the list it was consed onto. After some manipulation
    and the use of [partition_Permutation] and [Forall_incl], this follows
    from the fact that we know the new element holds the relation on all
    elements of the original list [p], and therefore also holds it on the
    elements of the partitioned list.

(** * New Functions over Lists *)
(**
    In order to easily perform the operations we need on lists, we defined
    three major list functions of our own, each with their own proofs.
    These generalized list functions all help to make it much easier
    to deal with our polynomial and monomial lists later in the development.
  *)

(** ** Distributing two Lists: [distribute] *)
(* ========== distribute ========== *)
(**
    The first and most basic of the three is [distribute]. Similarly to the
    "FOIL" technique learned in middle school for multiplying two polynomials,
    this function serves to create every combination of one element from
    each list. It is done concisely with the use of higher order functions
    below.
  *)

Definition distribute {A} (l m : list (list A)) : list (list A) :=
  concat (map (fun a:(list A) => (map (app a) l)) m).

(**
    The [distribute] function will play a larger role later, mostly as a part of
    our polynomial multiplication function. For now, however, there are only
    two very simple lemmas to be proven, both stating that distributing [nil]
    over a list results in [nil].
  *)

Lemma distribute_nil : forall {A:Type} (p:list (list A)),
  distribute [] p = [].

  intros A p. induction p.

  distribute p [] = [].
Proof.
  intros A p. induction p.
  - auto.
  - unfold distribute in *. simpl in *. auto.
Qed.



(** ** Cancelling out Repeated Elements: [nodup_cancel] *)
(* ========== nodup_cancel ========== *)
(**
    The next list function, and possibly the most prolific function in our
    entire development, is [nodup_cancel]. Similarly to the standard library
    [nodup] function, [nodup_cancel] takes a list that may or may not have
    duplicates in it and returns a list without duplicates.

    The difference between ours and the standard function is that rather than
    just removing all duplicates and leaving one of each element, the elements
    in a [nodup_cancel] list cancel out in pairs. For example, the list
    [[1;1;1]] would become [[1]], whereas [[1;1;1;1]] would become [[]].

    This is implemented with the [count_occ] function and [remove], and is
    largely the reason for needing so many lemmas about those two functions.
    If there is an _even_ number of occurences of an element [a] in the original
    list [(a::l)], which implies there is an _odd_ number of occurences of this
    element in [l], then all instances are removed. On the other hand, if there
    is an _odd_ number of occurences in the original list, one occurence is
    kept, and the rest are removed.

    By calling [nodup_cancel] recursively on [xs] _before_ calling [remove],
    Coq is easily able to determine that [xs] is the decreasing argument,
    removing the need for a more complicated definition with "fuel".
  *)

Fixpoint nodup_cancel {A} Aeq_dec (l : list A) : list A :=
  match l with
  | [] => []
  | x::xs => 
    let count := (count_occ Aeq_dec xs x) in 
    let xs' := (remove Aeq_dec x (nodup_cancel Aeq_dec xs)) in
    if (even count) then x::xs' else xs'
  end.

(**
    Now onto lemmas. To begin with, there are a few facts true of [nodup]
    that are also true of [nodup_cancel], which are useful in many proofs.
    [nodup_cancel_in] is the same as the standard library's [nodup_in], with
    one important difference: this implication is _not_ bidirectional. Because
    even parity elements are removed completely, not all elements in [l] are
    guaranteed to be in [nodup_cancel l].

    [NoDup_nodup_cancel] is much simpler, and effectively exactly the same
    as [NoDup_nodup].

    In these proofs, and most others from this point on, the shape will be
    very similar to the proof of the corresponding [nodup] proof. The main
    difference is that, instead of destructing [in_dec] like one would
    for [nodup], we destruct the evenness of [count_occ], as that is what
    drives the main if statement of the function.

(**
    An interesting side effect of the "cancelling" behavior of this function
    is that while the number of occurences of an item may change after calling
    [nodup_cancel], the evenness of the count never will. If an element was
    odd before there will be one occurence, and if it was even before there
    will be none.

(**
    [Permutation_nodup] was challenging to prove before, and this version for
    [nodup_cancel] faces the same problems. The first and fourth cases are easy,
    and the second isn't too bad after using [count_occ_Permutation]. The third
    case faces the same problems as before, but requires some extra work when
    transitioning from reasoning about [count_occ (x::l) y)] to [count_occ (y::l) x].

    This is accomplished by using [even_succ], [negb_odd], and [negb_true_iff].
    In this way, we can convert something saying [even (S n) = true] to
    [even n = false].

    The entire point of defining nodup_cancel was so that repeated elements
    in a list cancel out; clearly then, if an entire list appears twice it
    will cancel itself out. This proof would be much easier if the order of
    remove and nodup_cancel was swapped, but the above proof of the two

    Lastly, one of the toughest [nodup_cancel] lemmas. Similarly to
    [nodup_pointless], if nodup_cancel is going to be applied later,
    there is no need for it to be applied twice. This lemma proves to be
    very useful when proving that two different polynomials are equal, because,
    as we will see later, there are often repeated calls to [nodup_cancel] inside
    one another. This lemma makes it significantly easier to deal with, as
    we can remove the redundant [nodup_cancel]s.

    This proof proved to be challenging, mostly because it is hard
    to reason about the parity of the same element in two different lists. In
    the proof, we begin with induction over [p], and then move to destructing
    the count of [a] in each list. The first case follows easily from the two
    even hypotheses, [count_occ_app], and a couple other lemmas. The second
    case is almost exactly the same, except [a] is removed by [nodup_cancel]
    and never makes it out front, so the call to [perm_skip] is removed.

    The third case, where [a] appears and odd number of times in [p] and an
    even number of times in [q], is slightly different, but still solved
    relatively easily with the use of [nodup_extra_remove]. The fourth case
    is by far the hardest. We begin by asserting that, since the count of [a]
    in [q] is odd, there must be at least one, and therefore we can rewrite
    with [In_split] to get [q] into the form of [l1++a++l2]. We then assert
    that, since the count of a in [q] is odd, the count in [l1++l2], or [q]
    with one [a] removed, must surely be even. These facts, combined with
    [remove_distr_app], [count_occ_app], and [nodup_cancel_remove_assoc], allow
    us to slowly but surely work [a] out to the front and eliminate it with
    [perm_skip]. All that is left to do at that point is to perform similar
    steps in the induction hypothesis, so that both [IHp] and our goal are in
    terms of [l1] and [l2]. [IHp] is then used to finish the proof.

(** ** Comparing Parity of Lists: [parity_match] *)
(* ========== parity_match ========== *)
(**
    The final major definition over lists we wrote is [parity_match].
    [parity_match] is closely related to [nodup_cancel], and allows us to
    make statements about lists being equal after applying [nodup_cancel] to
    them. Clearly, if an element appears an even number of times in both
    lists, then it won't appear at all after [nodup_cancel], and if an element
    appears an odd number of times in both lists, then it will appear once
    after [nodup_cancel]. The ultimate goal of creating this definition is to
    prove a lemma that if the parity of two lists matches, they are permutations
    of each other after applying [nodup_cancel].

    The definition simply states that for all elements, the parity of the
    number of occurences in each list is equal.

  forall x, even (count_occ Aeq_dec l x) = even (count_occ Aeq_dec m x).

(**
    A useful lemma in working towards this proof is that if the count of
    every variable in a list is even, then there will be no variables
    in the resulting list. This is relatively easy to prove, as we have
    already proven [not_in_nodup_cancel] and can contradict away the other

(**
    Finally, the big one. The first three cases are straightforward, especially
    now that we have already proven [parity_match_empty]. The third case is
    more complicated. We begin by destructing if [a] and [a0] are equal. In the
    case that they are, the proof is relatively straightforward;
    [parity_match_cons], [perm_skip], and [remove_Permutation] take care of it.

    In the case that they are not equal, we next destruct if the number of
    occurences is even or not. If it is odd, we can use [parity_match_In] and
    [In_split] to rewrite l2 in terms of [a]. From there, we use permutation
    facts to rearrange [a] to be at the front, and the rest of the proof is
    similar to the proof when [a] and [a0] are equal.

    The final case is when they are not equal and the number of occurences is
    even. After using [parity_match_cons_swap], we can get to a point where we
    know that [a] appears in [q++a0] an even number of times. This means that
    [a] will not be in [q++a0] after applying [nodup_cancel], so we can rewrite
    with [not_In_remove] in the reverse direction to get the two sides of the
    permutation goal to be more similar. Then, because it is wrapped in
    [remove a], we can clearly add an [a] on the inside without it having any
    effect. Then all that is left is to apply [remove_Permutation], and we end
    up with a goal matching the induction hypothesis.

    This lemma is very powerful, especially when dealing with [nodup_cancel]
    with functions applied to the elements of a list. This will come into
    play later in this file.

(** * Combining nodup_cancel and Other Functions *)
(** ** Using [nodup_cancel] over [map] *)
(* ========== nodup_cancel and map ========== *)
(**
    Our next goal is to prove things about the relation between [nodup_cancel]
    and [map] over lists. In particular, we want to prove a lemma similar to
    [nodup_cancel_pointless], that allows us to remove redundant [nodup_cancel]s.

    The challenging part of proving this lemma is that it is often hard to
    reason about how, for example, the number of times [a] appears in [p]
    relates to the number of times [f a] appears in [map f p]. Many of the
    functions we map across lists in practice are not one-to-one, meaning that
    there could be some [b] such that [f a = f b]. However, at the end of the
    day, these repeated elements will cancel out with each other and the
    parities will match, hence why [parity_nodup_cancel_Permutation] is
    extremely useful.

    To begin, we need to prove a couple facts comparing the number of occurences
    of elements in a list. The first lemma states that the number of times some
    [a] appears in [p] is less than or equal to the number of times [f a]
    appears in [map f p].

(**
    Building off this idea, the next lemma states that the number of times
    [f a] appears in [map f p] with [a] removed is equal to the count of
    [f a] in [map f p] minus the count of [a] in [p].

    It is also true that if there is some [x] that is _not_ equal to [f a],

    The next lemma is similar to [count_occ_map_lt], except it involves some

    of [a] in [p] and [b] in [p] is less than the count of [f a] in [map f p].

(**
    For the next lemma, we once again try to compare the count of [a] to the
    count of [f a], but also involve [nodup_cancel]. Clearly, there is no way

(**
    All of these lemmas now come together for the core one, a variation of
    [nodup_cancel_pointless] but involving [map f]. We begin by applying
    [parity_nodup_cancel_Permutation], and destructing if [a] appears in
    [p] an even number of times or not.

    The even case is relatively easy to prove, and only involves using the usual
    combination of [even_succ], [not_In_remove], and [not_in_nodup_cancel].

    The odd case is trickier, and where we involve all of the newly proved
    lemmas. If [x] and [f a] are not equal, the proof follows just from
    [count_occ_map_neq_remove] and the induction hypothesis.

    If they are equal, we begin by rewriting with [count_occ_map_sub] and
    [even_sub]. After a few more rewrites, it becomes the case that we need to
    prove that the boolean equivalence of the parities of [f a] in [map f p]
    and [a] in [p] is equal to the negated parity of [f a] in [map f p].
    Because we know that [a] appears in [p] an odd number of times from
    destructing [even] earlier, this follows immediately.

(** ** Using [nodup_cancel] over [concat map] *)
(* ========== nodup_cancel and concat map ========== *)
(**
    Similarly to map, the same property of not needing repeated [nodup_cancel]s
    applies when the lists are being concatenated and mapped over. This final
    section of the file seeks to, in very much the same way as earlier, prove
    this.

    We begin with a simple lemma about math that will come into play soon -
    if a number is less than or equal to 1, then it is either 0 or 1. This is
    immediately solved with firstorder logic.
  *)

Lemma n_le_1 : forall n,
  n <= 1 -> n = 0 \/ n = 1.
Proof.
  intros n H. induction n; firstorder.
Qed.

(**
    The main difference between this section and the section about map is that
    all of the functions being mapped will clearly be returning lists as their
    output, and then being concatenated with the rest of the result. This makes
    things slightly harder, as we can't reason about the number of times, for
    example, some [f a] appears in a list. Instead, we have to reason about the
    number of times that some [x] appears in a list, where [x] is one of the
    elements of the list [f a].

    In practice, these lemmas are only going to be applied in situations where
    every [f a] has no duplicates in it. In other words, as the lemma above
    states, there will be either 0 or 1 of each x in a list. The next two
    lemmas prove some consequences of this.

    First is that if the count of [x] in [f a] is 0, then clearly removing
    [a] from some list [p] will not affect the count of [x] in the
    concatenated version of the list.

  rewrite count_occ_app. destruct Aeq_dec.

Qed.

(**
    On the other hand, if the count of some [x] in [f a] is 1, then the
    count of [a] in the original list must be less than or equal to the
    count of [x] in the final list, depending on if some [b] exists such that
    [f a] also contains [x]. More useful is the fact that if [x] appears once
    in [f x], the count of [x] in the final list with [a] removed is equal
    to the count of [x] in the final list minus the count of [a] in the list.
    Both of these proofs are relatively straightforward, and mostly follow
    from firstorder logic.

    Continuing the pattern of proving similar facts as we did during the
    [map] proof, we now prove a version of [f_equal_sum_lt] involving [concat].
    This lemma states that, if we know there will be no duplicates in [f x] for
    all [x], and that there are some [a] and [b] such that they are not equal
    but [x] in in both [f a] and [f b], then clearly the sum of the count of [a]
    and the count of [b] is less than or equal to the count of [x] in the list
    after applying the function and concatenating.

(**
    The last step before we are able to prove [nodup_cancel_concat_map] is
    to actually involve [nodup_cancel] rather than just [remove]. This lemma
    states that given [f x] has no duplicates and [a] appears once in [f a],
    the count of [a] in [p] after applying nodup_cancel is less than or equal
    to the count of [x] after applying [concat map] and [nodup_cancel].

    The first cases, when the count is even, are relatively straightforward.
    The second cases, when the count is odd, are slightly more complicated. We
    destruct if [a] and [b] (where [b] is our induction element) are equal. If
    they are, then the proof is solved by firstorder logic. On the other hand,
    if they are not, we make use of our [n_le_1] fact proved before to find out
    how many times [x] appears in [f b]. If it is zero, then we rewrite with
    the [0] fact proved earlier and are done. In the final case, we rewrite
    with the [1] subtraction fact we proved earlier, and it follows from
    [f_equal_concat_sum_lt].

(**
    Finally, the proof we've been building up to. Once again, we begin the proof
    by converting to a [parity_match] problem and then perform induction on the
    list. The case where [a] appears an even number of times in the list is
    easy, and follows from the same combination of [count_occ_app] and [even_add]
    that we have used before.

    The case where [a] appears an odd number of times is slightly more complex.
    Once again, we apply [n_le_1] to determine how many times our [x] appears
    in [f a]. If it is zero times, we use [count_occ_map_sub_not_in] like above,
    and then the induction hypothesis solves it. If [x] appears once in [f a],
    we instead use [count_occ_map_sub_in] combined with [even_sub]. Then, after
    rewriting with the induction hypothesis, we can easily solve the lemma with
    the use of [count_occ_nodup_cancel].
