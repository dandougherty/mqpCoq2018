 Since 11/20/18:
	Done:
		- Reorganized project structure with Dylan. More information in his changelog.
		- Worked on replacing lemmas involving polynomials to use my listset as opposed to dylan's ordered lists
		- Worked on lemmas about properties of polynomial math in poly.v (effectively working to prove the 10 axioms hold)
		- Worked on other admitted lemmas used for Dylan's proof of 10.4.10 part 1.
	Problems:
		- Huge technical issue on my end. I'm unable to work with the project structure in it's current state, and
		  after three hours of troubleshooting, the only way I have been able to develop at all is by copy-pasting 
		  all previous required exports into the top of the same file. This needs to be fixed ASAP but I've hit a
		  road block at every turn.
		- Have run into some issues when proving things involving polynomials and monomials. Specifically, I need
		  the equals operator to treat sets that are ordered differently the same (ie, NoDup (a :: x) should mean
		  that a :: x = x ++ [a] in set terms). Maybe the listset representation is the wrong way to go?
	To-Do:
		- Fix my computer so that I'm actually able to work on the project!
		- Further examine representation of polynomials, and find a way to resolve the order problem.
		- Begin working on part 2 of theorem 10.4.10 (sigma' built with the SVE rules is a reprod unifier)
		- Prove more of the underlying admitted lemmas to make sure we aren't moving forward on an incorrect foundation
