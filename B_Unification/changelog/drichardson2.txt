 Since 11/20/18:
 	- Reorganized project structure with Matt. There are now 6 files. Two are for the data structures; terms and polynomials. Two are for definitions and lemmas about unification in each representation. One file for both of the algorithms.
 	- Decided on representing polynomials as list sets instead of ascending lists. Order only played a role in the decomp function which has been redefined to use partition.
 	- Prove the first fact of Theorem 10.4.10 from the book. It uses admitted lemmas.
 	- Fix the definition of mgu and reporductive unifier, by changing an implication to an and.
