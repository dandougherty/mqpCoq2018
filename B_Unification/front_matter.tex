\begin{abstract}
    We report on a verified implementation of two (well-known) algorithms for
    unification modulo the theory of Boolean rings: Lowenheim's method and the
    method of Successive Variable Elimination. The implementations and proofs of
    correctness were done in the Coq proof assistant; we view this contribution as
    an early step in a larger project of developing a suite of verified
    implementations of equational unification algorithms.
