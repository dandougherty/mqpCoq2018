The Five Rhetorical Moves
-------------------------

A good strategy for an introduction to a paper is to address the
following 5 points:

1) establish the broad general research area or problem;

2) introduce the specific problem at hand;

3) provide context by summarizing previous work, what is already known,
and/or what has already been done;

4) create a research space by identifying a gap in previous work or
opportunities for extension or new work;

5) establish the place of the current paper by stating what
contribution(s) it makes in light of (4) above.
